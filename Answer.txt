I have used NoSql DB because



1 .The size of the URL list could grow infinitely, how might you scale this beyond the memory capacity of the system?
    Here due to some work load which i had this week ,i have used mongoDB.But for this kind of use case we can go with elastic search
    In elastic search we can use cluster and add n number of nodes where we can grow the memory according to the use.

2.The number of requests may exceed the capacity of this system, how might you solve that?
    We can have load balancer,we can have a configuration where if the requests exceed "n" number then we can redirect to the other machine.
    or using the load balaner we can split requests to two machines


3. What are some strategies you might use to update the service with new URLs? Updates may be as much as 5 thousand URLs a day with updates arriving ev0 minutes.
    We can use threading concept to load the urls to the service parallely.
